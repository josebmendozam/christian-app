I've always been fascinated by what code can achieve and how far imagination can take us. Building useful apps for users fulfills me and makes me want to continue and get better at it every day. I started teaching myself iOS development while I was attending Western Governors University for Computer Science at the same time. I've always been interested in building meaningful apps that could make people's lives better and this motivation also includes everything I do in life on a daily basis.
